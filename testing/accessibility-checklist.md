# TiberiusAI Website Accessibility Testing Checklist

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive checklist for testing the accessibility of the TiberiusAI website according to WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Use this checklist to systematically verify that the website is accessible to users with disabilities.

## Automated Testing

### Tools to Use
- [ ] Run WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool) on all key pages
- [ ] Use axe DevTools for in-depth analysis
- [ ] Test with Lighthouse Accessibility audit
- [ ] Check color contrast with WebAIM Color Contrast Checker

## Keyboard Accessibility

### Navigation & Focus
- [ ] All interactive elements can be accessed using the keyboard alone
- [ ] Keyboard focus is clearly visible at all times
- [ ] Tab order follows a logical sequence
- [ ] No keyboard traps (where focus cannot be moved away from an element)
- [ ] Skip to content link is available at the beginning of the page
- [ ] Focus is properly managed after modal dialogs, form submissions, etc.

### Functionality
- [ ] All functionality is operable via keyboard
- [ ] Custom elements (like dropdowns) can be operated with the keyboard
- [ ] Hover effects have keyboard-accessible equivalents
- [ ] Menu items are navigable with arrow keys (if applicable)

## Screen Reader Compatibility

### Text Alternatives
- [ ] All images have appropriate alt text
- [ ] Decorative images have empty alt attributes or are background images
- [ ] Complex images (charts, diagrams) have detailed descriptions
- [ ] SVG elements have proper accessibility attributes

### Structure and Semantics
- [ ] Proper HTML5 semantic elements are used (header, nav, main, etc.)
- [ ] Headings are properly structured (h1-h6) and used hierarchically
- [ ] Lists are properly marked up as `<ul>`, `<ol>`, or `<dl>`
- [ ] Tables have proper headers and captions
- [ ] ARIA landmarks are used appropriately
- [ ] ARIA attributes are used correctly where needed

### Forms
- [ ] All form inputs have associated labels
- [ ] Required fields are clearly indicated and announced
- [ ] Error messages are associated with the relevant form fields
- [ ] Form validation errors are announced to screen readers
- [ ] Groups of related form elements use fieldset and legend

## Visual Design and Readability

### Color and Contrast
- [ ] Text has sufficient contrast against its background (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- [ ] Color is not used as the only means of conveying information
- [ ] UI components have sufficient contrast (3:1)
- [ ] Focus indicators have sufficient contrast (3:1)

### Text and Typography
- [ ] Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- [ ] Text spacing can be adjusted without breaking content
- [ ] Line height is at least 1.5 times the font size
- [ ] Paragraph spacing is at least 2 times the font size
- [ ] Letter spacing is at least 0.12 times the font size
- [ ] Word spacing is at least 0.16 times the font size

### Layout and Responsiveness
- [ ] Content reflows properly when zoomed to 400%
- [ ] Content is readable and functional at various viewport sizes
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling at viewport widths of 320px or greater
- [ ] Touch targets are at least 44x44 pixels

## Time-Based Media and Animation

### Videos and Audio
- [ ] Pre-recorded videos have captions
- [ ] Pre-recorded audio-only content has transcripts
- [ ] Audio/video controls are accessible via keyboard
- [ ] Auto-playing audio can be paused or stopped

### Animations
- [ ] Animations respect prefers-reduced-motion settings
- [ ] No content flashes more than 3 times per second
- [ ] Animations can be paused, stopped, or hidden
- [ ] Movement does not distract from content
- [ ] Parallax effects don't interfere with readability

## Cognitive Considerations

### Readability and Predictability
- [ ] Instructions are clear and do not rely on shape, size, or visual location
- [ ] Navigation mechanisms are consistent across pages
- [ ] Elements that appear on multiple pages are consistent
- [ ] Forms have clear instructions and helpful error messages
- [ ] Technical jargon is minimized or explained

### User Control
- [ ] Session timeouts have warnings and options to extend
- [ ] Auto-updating content can be paused, stopped, or hidden
- [ ] Users can control carousel/slideshow timing
- [ ] No unexpected changes of context when navigating or entering data

## Testing with Assistive Technology

### Screen Readers
- [ ] Test with at least one screen reader (NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS)
- [ ] Page title is appropriate and descriptive
- [ ] Headings and landmarks provide clear navigation structure
- [ ] Form inputs are properly labeled and grouped
- [ ] Error messages are properly announced
- [ ] Dynamic content changes are announced

### Additional Assistive Technologies
- [ ] Test with screen magnification
- [ ] Test with voice recognition software (if possible)
- [ ] Test with alternative navigation devices (if possible)

## Browser and Device Compatibility

- [ ] Test accessibility features across different browsers
- [ ] Check focus visibility works in all browsers
- [ ] Verify screen reader compatibility across browsers
- [ ] Test touch interfaces for accessibility
- [ ] Check keyboard accessibility on different operating systems

## Documentation
