# TiberiusAI Website Performance Testing Checklist

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive checklist for testing and optimizing the performance of the TiberiusAI website. It focuses on Core Web Vitals, animation performance, asset optimization, and user experience metrics.

## Core Web Vitals Testing

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- [ ] Identify the largest contentful paint element for each key page
- [ ] Verify LCP occurs within 2.5 seconds or less
- [ ] Apply appropriate optimizations:
  - [ ] Preload critical resources
  - [ ] Optimize image loading and sizing
  - [ ] Implement critical CSS
  - [ ] Server-side render important content

### First Input Delay (FID) / Interaction to Next Paint (INP)
- [ ] Measure input delay on interactive elements
- [ ] Verify FID is less than 100ms
- [ ] Measure INP across key user interactions
- [ ] Apply appropriate optimizations:
  - [ ] Break up long tasks
  - [ ] Optimize event handlers
  - [ ] Use web workers for heavy processing
  - [ ] Implement code splitting
  - [ ] Defer non-critical JavaScript

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- [ ] Measure layout shift score across key pages
- [ ] Verify CLS is less than 0.1
- [ ] Apply appropriate optimizations:
  - [ ] Set explicit dimensions for images and embeds
  - [ ] Reserve space for dynamic content
  - [ ] Avoid inserting content above existing content
  - [ ] Prefer transform animations over ones that trigger layout

## Animation Performance

### Canvas Animation (AnimatedBackground)
- [ ] Measure frame rate during animation (target: 60fps)
- [ ] Check CPU usage during animation
- [ ] Verify smooth animation on low-end devices
- [ ] Apply appropriate optimizations:
  - [ ] Use requestAnimationFrame correctly
  - [ ] Implement throttling for intensive calculations
  - [ ] Reduce particle count on mobile or lower-powered devices
  - [ ] Respect prefers-reduced-motion settings

### CSS Animations and Transitions
- [ ] Check for smooth CSS transitions and animations
- [ ] Identify any animations causing layout thrashing
- [ ] Verify animations use GPU-accelerated properties when possible
- [ ] Apply appropriate optimizations:
  - [ ] Use transform and opacity for animations
  - [ ] Apply will-change property judiciously
  - [ ] Reduce animation complexity on mobile

## Asset Optimization

### Images
- [ ] Verify all images are properly sized for their display dimensions
- [ ] Check that appropriate image formats are used (WebP, AVIF where supported)
- [ ] Confirm lazy loading is implemented for below-the-fold images
- [ ] Verify responsive images are implemented with srcset
- [ ] Check image compression levels (balancing quality and file size)

### JavaScript
- [ ] Analyze JavaScript bundle size
- [ ] Verify code splitting is implemented
- [ ] Check for unused JavaScript
- [ ] Confirm proper caching strategies for JavaScript files
- [ ] Apply appropriate optimizations:
  - [ ] Tree shaking
  - [ ] Dynamic imports for non-critical code
  - [ ] Minification and compression

### CSS
- [ ] Analyze CSS file size
- [ ] Check for unused CSS
- [ ] Verify critical CSS is inlined
- [ ] Confirm proper CSS loading strategies
- [ ] Apply appropriate optimizations:
  - [ ] CSS minification
  - [ ] Remove unused styles
  - [ ] Use appropriate media queries

### Fonts
- [ ] Check web font loading strategy
- [ ] Verify font files are properly optimized
- [ ] Confirm font display settings prevent invisible text
- [ ] Apply appropriate optimizations:
  - [ ] Font subsetting
  - [ ] font-display: swap
  - [ ] Preload critical fonts

## Server Performance

### Response Times
- [ ] Measure server response time (TTFB)
- [ ] Verify TTFB is less than 500ms
- [ ] Check API response times
- [ ] Apply appropriate optimizations:
  - [ ] Server-side caching
  - [ ] API response optimization
  - [ ] CDN usage

### Static Generation
- [ ] Verify static pages are generated correctly
- [ ] Check build performance
- [ ] Confirm ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) is working as expected
- [ ] Test static fallback pages

## NextJS-Specific Optimizations

### Next.js Optimization Features
- [ ] Verify Image component is used correctly
- [ ] Check Link prefetching behavior
- [ ] Confirm dynamic imports are used where appropriate
- [ ] Verify next/script is used properly for third-party scripts
- [ ] Check that font optimization is enabled

### Build and Runtime Optimization
- [ ] Analyze build output size
- [ ] Check for duplicate dependencies
- [ ] Verify proper caching headers
- [ ] Check for hydration errors

## User Experience Metrics

### Perceived Performance
- [ ] Check loading indicators for operations
- [ ] Verify skeleton screens or placeholders during loading
- [ ] Confirm appropriate visual feedback for user actions
- [ ] Test perceived performance on slow connections

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Set up real user monitoring
- [ ] Establish performance budgets
- [ ] Create alerting for performance regressions
- [ ] Implement regular performance testing in development process

## Testing Environment

### Testing Tools
- [ ] Lighthouse (in Chrome DevTools)
- [ ] WebPageTest.org
- [ ] Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- [ ] Next.js Analytics
- [ ] Google PageSpeed Insights

### Testing Conditions
- [ ] Test on multiple device types (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- [ ] Test on multiple connection speeds (Fast 3G, Slow 3G)
- [ ] Test on multiple CPU performance levels (4x/6x slowdown)
- [ ] Test with cache disabled and enabled

## Documentation
