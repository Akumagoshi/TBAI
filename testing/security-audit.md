# TiberiusAI Website Security Audit Checklist

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive security audit checklist for the TiberiusAI website. It covers common web application security concerns with a focus on the NextJS and React-based architecture of the site.

## Form Security

### Input Validation
- [ ] All user inputs are properly validated on both client and server side
- [ ] Input validation includes type, length, format, and range checks
- [ ] Validation error messages don't reveal sensitive information
- [ ] Sanitization is applied to prevent XSS attacks
- [ ] Form submissions use proper HTTP methods (POST for data changes)

### CSRF Protection
- [ ] NextJS built-in CSRF protection is enabled and configured
- [ ] All state-changing operations use CSRF tokens
- [ ] CSRF tokens are properly verified on the server
- [ ] Forms include csrf tokens in hidden fields

### File Upload Security (if applicable)
- [ ] File uploads validate file type, size, and content
- [ ] Uploaded files are stored outside the web root
- [ ] Filenames are sanitized and randomized
- [ ] File content is scanned for malicious code

## Authentication & Authorization (if applicable)

### Authentication
- [ ] Password requirements follow NIST guidelines
- [ ] Account lockout policy is implemented for failed login attempts
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication is supported
- [ ] Session identifiers are securely generated and managed
- [ ] Sensitive credentials are never stored in client-side code or logs

### Authorization
- [ ] Proper access controls are in place for protected resources
- [ ] Server-side verification of permissions is implemented
- [ ] UI elements are hidden based on permissions

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling
- [ ] PII is properly identified and protected
- [ ] Form data is encrypted during transmission (HTTPS)
- [ ] Proper data classification is implemented
- [ ] Data minimization practices are followed

### Supabase Security
- [ ] Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies are configured
- [ ] API keys have appropriate permissions
- [ ] .env file with Supabase credentials is properly secured
- [ ] Database queries are parameterized to prevent SQL injection
- [ ] Production database has proper backup and recovery procedures

## Configuration & Infrastructure

### HTTPS Implementation
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced for all connections
- [ ] HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled
- [ ] Secure cookies are used (with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite flags)
- [ ] Strong TLS configuration (TLS 1.2+, strong ciphers)

### HTTP Security Headers
- [ ] Content-Security-Policy is configured and validated
- [ ] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff is set
- [ ] X-Frame-Options header is set (to prevent clickjacking)
- [ ] Referrer-Policy is configured appropriately
- [ ] Permissions-Policy is configured to restrict features

### NextJS Security
- [ ] next.config.js has appropriate security settings
- [ ] Proper CSP settings are configured
- [ ] Image optimization is configured securely
- [ ] Server-side rendering security concerns are addressed

## Dependency Security

### NPM Package Audit
- [ ] Run `npm audit` to check for vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] Regular updates of dependencies to patch security issues
- [ ] No unnecessary dependencies are included
- [ ] Lock files (package-lock.json) are used and maintained

### Third-Party Components
- [ ] Third-party libraries and components are vetted for security
- [ ] External scripts are loaded securely (integrity, subresource integrity)
- [ ] Content from CDNs is properly validated

## Code Security

### General Code Security
- [ ] No sensitive information in client-side code
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets, tokens, or credentials
- [ ] Code follows security best practices
- [ ] Regular code reviews with security focus

### React-Specific Security
- [ ] No use of dangerouslySetInnerHTML without proper sanitization
- [ ] React state is used securely
- [ ] React props are validated with PropTypes or TypeScript
- [ ] No sensitive data stored in localStorage or sessionStorage

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing
- [ ] Run automated security scanners on the application
- [ ] Regular OWASP Top 10 vulnerability scanning
- [ ] API endpoint security testing
- [ ] Scan for common security misconfigurations

### Manual Security Testing
- [ ] Attempt to bypass client-side validation
- [ ] Test for business logic vulnerabilities
- [ ] Check error handling for information disclosure
- [ ] Test session handling and management

## Incident Response

### Preparation
- [ ] Security incident response plan is documented
- [ ] Contacts and escalation procedures are defined
- [ ] Security logging and monitoring are in place
- [ ] Regular backups and restore procedures are tested

## Documentation & Audit

For each security issue found, document the following:

- **Issue**: Description of the vulnerability
- **OWASP Category**: Which OWASP Top 10 category it falls under
- **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
- **Recommendation**: Suggested fix
- **Status**: Open/In Progress/Fixed

## Security Audit Log

| Component | Issue | OWASP Category | Severity | Status |
|-----------|-------|---------------|----------|--------|
|           |       |               |          |        |
|           |       |               |          |        |

## OWASP Top 10 Reference (2021)

1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
7. Identification and Authentication Failures
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery
