# TiberiusAI Website Testing Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive testing tools, checklists, and documentation for the TiberiusAI website. This README serves as a guide for the testing process, explaining how to use the testing resources effectively.

## Testing Dashboard

The main testing dashboard is available at:

```
testing/index.html
```

This interactive dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to run various tests and view results. To use the dashboard:

1. Start the Next.js development server (`npm run dev`)
2. Open the dashboard in your browser (typically at http://localhost:3000/testing/index.html)
3. Use the various test buttons to run tests and see the results in real-time

## Testing Resources

### Automated Testing

- **[automated-tests.js](./automated-tests.js)**: Contains automated tests for performance, accessibility, and functionality. This script can be run from the dashboard or directly in the browser console.
